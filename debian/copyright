 Calling this script install-sh is preferred over install.sh, to
 prevent `make' implicit rules from creating a file called install
 from it when there is no Makefile.
 .
 This script is compatible with the BSD install script, but was
 written from scratch.  It can only install one file at a time, a
 restriction shared with many OS's install programs.
